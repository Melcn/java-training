This is my Java training repository, it's a bit like my brain gym, you know? 
It's normal that you'll find some rather simple algorithms here, as the goal isn't to showcase impressive performance :)

### Easy.quick

These are simply basic algorithms, easy and quick ones. 
I enjoy working on them from time to time, especially when I'm not engaged in large projects, as it keeps my mind engaged in thoughtful exercises.

### Test

This is where I experiment with things or learn when I encounter new concepts.

Feel free to suggest algorithmic challenges to me
